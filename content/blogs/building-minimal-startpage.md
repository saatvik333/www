# building a minimal startpage

when it comes to browser extensions, the new tab page is prime real estate. here's how i built a minimal, aesthetic startpage.

## the problem

default new tab pages are cluttered with news, ads, and distractions. i wanted something that:

- loads instantly
- shows only what i need
- looks good

## the solution

i created tabula - a minimal new tab extension that focuses on:

1. **speed** - no network requests on load
2. **simplicity** - just the essentials
3. **aesthetics** - dark mode, clean typography

## implementation

the extension is built with:

- typescript for type safety
- vanilla css for styling
- vite for bundling

## conclusion

sometimes less is more. a clean new tab page helps maintain focus and reduces cognitive load.
